# Programming Usable Interfaces

👋 Welcome to PUI! Here is some essential information.

## Setup tutorials

First, set up your system such that you can run examples and solve homework assignments efficiently. We have created step-by-step tutorials for you.

1. [Github setup tutorial](./setup-tutorials/GithubSetup.md)
2. Development Environment setup: [For Mac Users](./setup-tutorials/DeveloperEnvironment--Mac.md) and [for Windows users](./setup-tutorials/DeveloperEnvironment--Win.md)

## Homework assignments setup and deployment

When you're done setting up your GitHub account and development environment, use this tutorial to set up a repository for all your homework assignments:

3. [Homework deployment on GitHub](./setup-tutorials/HWDeployment.md)
4. [Homework submission on Gradescope](./setup-tutorials/HWSubmission.md)

When you're done, your homework repository will look like [**this example repo**](https://github.com/interactive-structures/pui-homework-template), which is live at [this link](https://interactive-structures.org/pui-homework-template/). You'll be able to add your code to your own repository and have it be visible in your own GitHub Pages site.
